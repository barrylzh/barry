        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Zhenhao Li. I'm 19 years old. I used to have long hair, but I had my hair cut before I came to the United States. I am currently studying at the University of California, Riverside, and I graduated from an international school in China. I like basketball since I was young. According to my dad, basketball helped me learn to walk. Less than a year old, my father let me stand against the wall, he put the ball away from me two or three steps, let me catch the ball, I staggered a few steps, caught the ball, very happy; He put the ball further away from me to tease me... In this way, I learned to walk.

After primary school, every weekend, no matter how much homework, I have to go to the community basketball court to play basketball, but basketball court is always junior high school students "bully field", we want to play words have to play with them, junior high school students always look at us with contempt, but we are not discouraged.

Once, I competed with junior high school students and lost miserably.Just listen to "du" a whistle, the ball has been thrown into the air, already ready for our team Wu Feng jumped, stretched out a huge hand, struggling to strike, the ball just fell in liu Jiahui's hands. He looked around and quickly dribbled the ball and ran across the midfield line. There was an empty crotch in the direction of my position. Liu Jiahui saw the right opportunity to pass the ball to my hands. The other player sees the matter is not good, rush to rush to defend. My ball has been out, but the other player brake car, or with me hit a full, I crawl in the place, eyes do not turn staring at the ball, I saw the basketball deliberately want to oppose like, in the basket played a few times, just slowly fell in. I jumped to my feet, Shouting and shaking my fists. This class cheerleaders are also very excited, they cheer loudly for us, waving their own colorful flags. This is, the other side serve, but they did not alert my class surprise move, the ball is not steady, I was grabbed away, passed to Liu Jiahui, Liu regardless of 37, 21, catch the ball, the ball across a beautiful arc from the air, into! Once again, the house went wild. My brother could not see, said to me: you do not always stand in the same place, to the past to prevent people, hands open "dead" to prevent others. I did according to my brother's words, stole a few junior high school ball, but it did not have any use. Because I didn't have the shooting skills and teamwork skills at that time, I just rushed forward recklessly when I got the ball and couldn't make it. My brother told me to play with my teammates, but shoot when I get the chance. I slowly learned this skill, as long as a teammate has the opportunity, I will pass to him, I have the opportunity to shoot, the number of shots more and more, junior high school students were defeated by our team cooperation strategy, to leave the field with angry faces.

I like playing basketball, playing basketball can not only exercise, but also cultivate the spirit of teamwork and perseverance, courage to go forward.<br><br>
